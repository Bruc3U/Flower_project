- Python (matplotlib, pandas)


## Objective

In the midst of machine learning development, PictureThis a plant recognition app, sparked our interest.<br>
Developed by the private company Glority, which was founded in 2009, their new app PictureThis allows users to take a photo of any plant and get an accurate result.<br>

PictureThis allows users to recognize plant species and also to have an analysis of the plant‚Äôs health, through pictures.<br> 
The app will let you know the current health state of your plant as well as recommendations on how to treat the condition. 
Since this kind of technology can be quite expensive to develop our question will be to test a similar version on Google Cloud‚Äôs platform.<br>

With a budget of 50 USD, our goal will be to create an accurate version of the app. We will only focus on the plant recognition techniques and leave the other features for a future project.<br>
Being able to create a more cost-effective version of the technology could be useful for smaller structures that do not have the resources to hire a dedicated team on such a project. 


## About the dataset

Our project will feature 3 different species of maple trees: Acer palmatum (regular maple tree), Japanese maple, and the Japanese red maple.<br> 
Most of the pictures were taken at the Dallas Botanical Garden.<br>

Our training dataset is composed of 300 pictures (100 pictures per plant species), 80% of those pictures will be ‚Äòlive‚Äô pictures, and the remaining 20% will be online pictures.<br> 
Our train and test dataset will have both high-quality pictures (80% taken from a Sony Camera, 21Mp) and regular-quality pictures (20% taken from an iPhone 11,12Mp). Since the app can also accept saved pictures.<br>

On another note, the raw data was collected on a sunny day, with normal exposure, since our time and budget are restricted, capturing accuracy with different lighting will be part of another endeavor.<br>
Our project will focus on standard cases, which means that our pictures will feature only the top part of the leaf, the app does not support other sides and asks for a clear, well-lighted picture. <br>

The obvious limitation of our dataset is the number and variety of pictures.<br>
Machine learning performs better on larger datasets with a lot of examples to ‚Äòlearn‚Äô better. We will be accepting differences in accuracy.<br>

 The test data set is composed of 20 randomly selected pictures from a 100-picture pool. Those pictures will appear in 12 and 21 Mega Pixel, some will have hands or shadows to try to ‚Äòtrick‚Äô the prediction software.
